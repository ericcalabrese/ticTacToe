Tic Tac Toe

This game was made via create-react-app and is my version of the famous game, Tic Tac Toe. The main component is TicTacToe.js as this has all the functionality of the game including winning combos, state changes, game conditions etc

This game functions off of several manipulations of the state including, player1, player2, board and winner. The game starts as an empty array and each user input is tracked until it reaches one of the hardcoded winning Tic Tac Toe combinations. Once the winner is selected it checks the condition found in the render to replace the game board with the winner and the option to play again.
